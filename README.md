# :pencil: POS Tagging as Sequence Labelling :question:

This repository contains the first assignment part of the **Natural Language Processing** course of the [Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence), University of Bologna. 

# Project Details


The main objective of such assignment is to solve a **Part-of-Speech** (POS) *tagging as Sequence Labelling task* on a *dependency treebank* dataset using pre-trained Glove embeddings.

We provided four different models and their implementation to test if any architecture is better than the other. For more details on the pipeline followed please read the report present in the report `pos_tagging_sequence_labelling.pdf`.
